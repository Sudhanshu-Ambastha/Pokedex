## gh-pages deployment

This section outlines how to deploy your Pokedex to GitHub Pages.

1.  **Install the `gh-pages` package as a development dependency:**
    ```bash
    npm install gh-pages --save-dev
    ```

2.  **Add deployment scripts to your `package.json`:**
    Open your `package.json` file and add the following scripts to the `scripts` section:

    ```json
    "scripts": {
      // ... other scripts
      "predeploy": "npm run build",
      "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
    }
    ```
    * `predeploy`: This script will build your project before deployment.
    * `deploy`: This script will publish the `dist` folder (your build output) to the `gh-pages` branch. **Note:** If your build output folder is different (e.g., `build`), adjust the `-d` flag accordingly.

3.  **Build your project:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

4.  **Deploy to GitHub Pages:**
    ```bash
    npm run deploy
    ```

5.  **Configure GitHub Pages in your repository settings:**
    * Go to your GitHub repository's **Settings** tab.
    * Navigate to **Pages** (usually in the left sidebar).
    * Under "Source", select **Deploy from a branch**.
    * Choose the **gh-pages** branch.
    * Set the "Folder" to **/(root)**.
    * Click **Save**.

    Your Pokedex will be live at `https://Sudhanshu-Ambastha.github.io/Pokedex`.
